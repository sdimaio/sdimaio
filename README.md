### Hello Everyone! 👋

I'm a ✨ Solution Architect and Developer ✨ with a great passion for Information Technology since 1991. 

I'm a technology enthusiast and appreciate the open source project for the deep insight of how things work. I'm working as a full time engineer in the mostly proprietary company of Telco, Public Sectors and industrial automation software. 

I study Computer Science at #[Unicas](https://www.unicas.it/). Previously, Electronic Engineering at #[UniNa](http://www.unina.it).
